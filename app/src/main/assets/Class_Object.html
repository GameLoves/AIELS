    <h1>Classes and Objects in C#</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Classes and Objects</h2>

    <p>A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. In C#, a class defines the data and behavior of an object. Here's an example:</p>

    <pre><code>
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void SayHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am " + Age + " years old.");
    }
}

Person john = new Person();
john.Name = "John";
john.Age = 30;
john.SayHello(); // writes "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old." to the console
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, we define a class named <code>Person</code> with two properties named <code>Name</code> and <code>Age</code>, and a method named <code>SayHello</code>. We then create an object of the <code>Person</code> class named <code>john</code>, set its properties, and call its <code>SayHello</code> method.</p>

    <h3>Types of Classes</h3>

    <p>In C#, there are different types of classes based on their accessibility and behavior. Here are some of the commonly used types of classes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public class:</strong> A public class is accessible from anywhere in the code and can be used by other classes and objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Private class:</strong> A private class is only accessible within the same file or class and cannot be used by other classes and objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract class:</strong> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be used as a base class for other classes. It can contain abstract and non-abstract methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Sealed class:</strong> A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited by other classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Static class:</strong> A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains only static members such as fields, properties, and methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Access Modifiers</h3>

    <p>In C#, access modifiers are used to control the access to the members of a class. Here are the access modifiers that can be used with classes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public:</strong> A public class is accessible from anywhere in the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal:</strong> An internal class is accessible only within the same assembly (or project).</li>
        <li><strong>Protected:</strong> A protected class is accessible only within the same class or its derived classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Private:</strong> A private class is accessible only within the same class.</li>
        <li><strong>Protected internal:</strong>A protected internal class is accessible within the same assembly (or project) or its derived classes, regardless of the assembly they are in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in C#. A class defines the blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. You can define different types of classes based on their accessibility and behavior. Access modifiers are used to control the access to the members of a class. Understanding these concepts is essential for creating robust and maintainable C# code.</p>
